On the Risq Protocol Options Desk, options buyers can determine the strike price they want and select between 4 different time periods, enter substantial depth facilitated by the AMM structure, and have assured execution throughout the entire period of the option as a result of the liquidity that is locked up withing each option contract.

It should be understood that there may be financial dangers involved with providing liquidity to pool contracts that may or may not be mitigated by the premiums and or the ongoing RISQ incentive program. LP risks should be understood before embarking on the options writing and liquidity providing program.

## What to consider prior to becoming an Options Writer LP

1. Options trading can be beneficial for portfolio risk management.  This strategy has long been  known to investors and crypto traders.  Trading options have been used as a strategy by investors through which they can curb the risk of placing positions as well as avoiding initial cash requirements.  On the other hand, options trading has its own particular components that the investor must understand before placing the order.  It is extremely important that traders study the pros and cons of options before using any options protocol decentralized or other.  
2. At this point, Risq Protocol and the Options Desk is still in Beta.  Investors do their own due diligence and learn how to use the platform before trading.

   * Put Definition: A put, in contrast, gives the holder of the underlying assets the right, not obligation to sell at a particular price on or before expiration.
2. Select the option size. This is expressed in units of the underlying asset (e.g. a 2 ETH calls will expose the buyer to the price fluctuations of two Ethereum Tokens).
