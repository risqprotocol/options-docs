# Purchasing Options from the Options Desk

On the Risq Protocol Options Desk, options buyers can set their own strike price and select between 4 different time durations, access significant depth enabled by the AMM model and have guaranteed execution throughout the duration of the option due to the liquidity that is locked into each option contract.

This guide will walk you through the steps required to purchase options on the [Options Desk](https://options.risq.capital/#/desk).

Note: There are significant risks associated with providing liquidity to pool contracts that may or may not be offset/compensated by the premiums and/or the current RISQ incentive program. Please make sure to understand the LP risks prior to becoming an options writer and providing liquidity.

## Important considerations before becoming an Options Writer LP

1. Options trading can provide many benefits to an investors or crypto trader's trading strategy or their portfolio risk management. Options can be highly appealing to investors as it allows for a number of strategies where-by investors can limit the risk of taking positions or the up front cost requirements. However, options have their own unique characteristics that should be understood by traders before being used. It is highly recommended that traders learn about options before utilizing any decentralized or centralized options protocol.
